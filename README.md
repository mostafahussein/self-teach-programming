# self-teach-programming
 in this repository i will post all the scripts I'm coding while learning a specific topic in programming in a specific programming language.  that will make it easier for me to look back at my coding style after i get better and it might be oneday a guide for someone who is learning programming by reading codes.  for now i will mostly code scripts in python,javascript,html&amp;css
